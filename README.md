## ðŸ§  Project Description

This project focuses on building and comparing two custom list implementations from scratch:

- **MyArrayList** â€“ a dynamic array-based list similar to Java's `ArrayList`
- **MyLinkedList** â€“ a singly linked list structure

Each list supports standard list operations like:
- Adding/removing elements
- Retrieving elements by index
- Inserting at specific positions
- Comparing performance on common tasks

The project includes a driver class (`ListTester.java`) that runs a set of functional and performance tests to evaluate the behavior and efficiency of both list implementations.

## âœ… Features

### MyArrayList
- Uses a dynamic resizing strategy
- Supports `add()`, `remove()`, `get()`, and `set()` methods
- Automatic resizing when capacity is reached

### MyLinkedList
- Node-based singly linked structure
- Supports element insertion/removal from any position
- Efficient memory use for frequent insertions

### ListTester
- Runs tests for correctness and timing
- Demonstrates differences in efficiency between the two implementations

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Compile the files:

```bash
javac src/*.java
java -cp src ListTester
